//  Screenshot capture for the `fastlane ios screenshots` lane.
//
//  Xcode 16 changed xcresult bundle storage: screenshots are no longer plain
//  PNGs inside the bundle — they are zstd-compressed blobs. `fastlane snapshot`
//  (which relied on SnapshotHelper) cannot extract them. This file captures
//  screenshots as `XCTAttachment` objects with `.keepAlways` lifetime; the
//  fastlane lane runs `scripts/extract_screenshots.sh` after the test to
//  extract them via `xcrun xcresulttool export attachments`.
//
